It also means automating some security gates to keep the DevOps workflow from slowing down. Selecting the right tools to continuously integrate security, like agreeing on an integrated development environment (IDE) with security features, can help meet these goals. However, effective DevOps security requires more than new tools - it builds on the cultural changes of DevOps to integrate the work of security teams sooner rather than later."</p>
